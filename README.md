# Sentiment-Recognition-Using-NLP

## About

This project involves sentiment recognition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify large amounts of random text data as positive or negative based on their textual content. The dataset includes textual data and corresponding labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive). The project focuses on preprocessing and visualizing the dataset, as well as building and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment classification.

The results depict that Logistic Regression Model performs the best, followed by Random Forest and lastly, Naive Bayes.
